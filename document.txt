I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
I love thee freelymaking changes to the section nowhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.

se,
I shall but love thee better after death.
